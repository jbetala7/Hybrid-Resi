                                with the LG Split screen. It allows you to easily divide the display surface into
                                several parts, enabling you to broadcast up to four different windows simultaneously
                                when using a computer. The four zones are displayed side by side and one above the
                                other. Its compatibility with Type C USB completes your portable workstation with a
                                single cable. Additionally, it features two built-in stereo speakers, eliminating the
                                need for external speakers. The height, tilt, and rotation support allow you to
                                customize the desktop configuration to create a more personal and comfortable
                                workstation.
